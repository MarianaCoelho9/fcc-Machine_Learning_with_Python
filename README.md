# fcc-Machine_Learning_with_Python
In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.  You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.




## Challenges:

- Rock Paper Scissors

Create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

- Cat and Dog Image Classifier (fcc_cat_dog.ipynb)

Complete the code to classify images of dogs and cats. You will use TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!)

- Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

Create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors. 

- Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

Predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. You are given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. Use the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.

- Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

Create a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
